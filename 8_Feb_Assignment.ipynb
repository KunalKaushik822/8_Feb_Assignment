    "\n",
    "# Incomplete Definition: An abstract class intentionally contains abstract methods, which lack implementation details. These methods act as placeholders, requiring concrete subclasses to provide their specific behavior. If you attempted to create an instance of the abstract class directly, you wouldn't know how to execute these unimplemented methods, leading to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conceptual Design: The very purpose of an abstract class is to define a common blueprint for related concrete classes that inherit and specialize its functionality. It represents a more general concept or interface rather than a specific, usable entity. Instantiating such a concept wouldn't make practical sense.\n",
